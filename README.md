This project is a simple banking web application built with Python, Streamlit, and SQLite.

Users can create an account, log in securely, and manage their balance. The app allows users to deposit and withdraw money, view their transaction history, and see real-time metrics such as current balance, total deposited, and total withdrawn. All user data and transactions are stored persistently using a SQLite database, and passwords are securely hashed with bcrypt.

The application is deployed on Streamlit Cloud and demonstrates core concepts such as authentication, session management, database integration, and interactive data visualization.
